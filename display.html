    <!-- Block elements are div,h,p...
     They have many properties like they occupy one complete line
     they take width from extreme left to extreme right of the page
     we can give custom height and width to them
     we can give padding , margin -->
    <div>Hello Everyone </div>
    <div>No hello this time</div>
    <!-- Div is a block element that is why the 2 are printed in different lines
     Span is an inline element so if we have two spans without break , they will print in one line
     If space is available it will print in one line otherwise in next line
     we cant apply custom width, height to inline elements
     custom margin can be applied only in horizontal direction
     padding can be appplied
     we can convert inline to block by changing display property
      -->
     <span>Harsh Here</span>
     <span>Harsh again</span>
         
    </div>
